Suppose that I have a notebook on my computer that can store many lines of text. I wrote a computer program that reads a bunch of texts, detects the "notebook commands" in the text, and executes the commands. There are 3 such commands:
1. ```
   $read_text <number>
   ```
   reads the text on specific line number
2. ```
   $write_text <number>
   <text>
   $end write_text
   ```
   writes text to specific line number. This command is a multiline command. The texts you want to write are after the line of $write_text and before the line of $end write_text. If you are writing multiple lines with this command, new lines will be appended between the line number in the parameter and the next line.
3. ```
   $add_line <number>
   ```
   add a new line after the given line number
4. ```
   $delete_line <number>
   ```
   delete the line on the given line number
   Where <number> represents a line number and <text> represents the content to write to the line. Left and right angle brackets are not part of the command.

Beside these commands to read from or write to the notebook, you can also use the $tell command to communicate with others.
$tell <name>
<text>
$end tell
Similar to the $write_text command, $tell is also a multiline command. The text you want to write is after the line of $tell command and before the line of $end tell.

The commands listed here -- "read_text, write_text, add_line, delete_line, tell" -- are all the commands you can use. There are no other commands beyond these or any variations of these commands.
